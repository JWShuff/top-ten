      <h2 title="I'm an H2">HTML</h2>
      <p title="I'm a p">My experience with front end and visual UX/UI design is basically 0. So I'm taking this as a chance to really stretch out what I suspect will be core methods and functionality.</p>

        <h3>The a element</h3>
        <p>So, the a element serves to format links and act as a clickable element on a page. It can point to links, emails, even <a class = "linkformat" href= #title> locations in this document!</a></p>
        <p>It also has all sorts of CSS styling options available that alter behavior from hovered, to clicked, and so on.</p>
        <!-- EXAMPLE CODE GOES HERE -->
      <pre title="i'm a pre tag for code!"> 
        < a > is the opening tag and < / a > is the closing tag. < a href= >normally begins the link, and you can use mailto:, #(insertIDInPageHere), or a web link. 
      </pre>
      <a href="https://htmlreference.io/element/a/">Heres the < a > link</a>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section" title="I'm a Definition Div!">
      <h3>The pre marker</h3>
      <p> I had to look up what the < pre > does in order to write things properly. So now you get to learn too! </p>

      <!-- EXAMPLE CODE GOES HERE -->
      <pre title="i'm a pre tag for code!"> 
        < pre > opens and < /pre > closes the block. No text is formatted in the block...but pre {} in your style sheet allows you to define a set styling for text inside of pre blocks.
      </pre>

          <h3>Input</h3>
          <p> 
            So input is almost definitely going to be a thing we use a ton. It's got some predefined "types" where it will do some data validation on your behalf and/or instruct mobile browsers what sorts of inputs to use.
          </p>

          <input type="text" name = "first_name" placeholder="The placeholder is default text that appears in your input box!">

          <p>
            input can also handle numbers, or email addresses. But you shouldn't count on the outputs of the element to be fully validated before use in your programs.
          </p>
          <pre title="i'm a pre tag for code!">
            input has a number of sections: name which is required and must be unique to the form, it allows the server to access each input's value when submitted.
            <br/>
            Best practice is to use a label, and then a placeholder with an example like such:
          </pre>
          <form>
            <label>Email</label><br>
            <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="e.g. alex@smith.com">
            </form>
          <br />
          <a class="https://htmlreference.io/element/input/" href=#>Heres the < input > link</a>

      <h3>Grid is <em>Awesome!</em> </h3>
      <p>Grid gives you a ton of control over how information is displayed: </p>
      <div id='wrapper'>
        <div id='one' class='grid-child'>
          And there's no real limit to how that all works.
        </div>
        <div id='two' class='grid-child'>You can have overlapping data, and I suspect we will learn how to do all sorts of awesome stuff with this.</div>
        <div id='three' class='grid-child'>Above and beyond writing text that piles on top of itself as I am currently doing.</div>
        <div id='four' class='grid-child'>But, I can see the potential from here and that counts for something.</div>
        <div id='five' class='grid-child'>CSS is gonna be cool.</div>
      </div>
      <!-- EXAMPLE CODE GOES HERE -->
